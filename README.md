# üì¶ SQL Inventory Management System

## üìå Overview

This SQL-based **Inventory Management System** was developed as part of our university project to efficiently manage inventory records. The project was built using **structured query language (SQL)** to store, manage, and retrieve inventory data.

We designed an **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** to establish clear relationships between inventory components and implemented various (found in Diagram folder) **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## üèóÔ∏è Features

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Inventory Tracking** ‚Äì Stores detailed records of products, suppliers, stock levels, and transactions.
‚úÖ **Relational Database Design** ‚Äì Implemented using an **ER Diagram** to ensure data consistency and efficient retrieval.
‚úÖ **SQL Queries for Data Analysis** ‚Äì Used **JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregate functions, subqueries, and stored procedures** for insights.
‚úÖ **Automated Stock Updates** ‚Äì Triggers and stored procedures manage stock levels dynamically.
‚úÖ **Security & Data Integrity** ‚Äì Enforced constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY) and normalization to prevent redundancy.

## üîπ Database Schema & ER Diagram

The system consists of multiple relational tables, including:

- **Product** (ProductID, Name, CategoryID, Price, Weight, Barcode)
- **Supplier** (SupplierID, Name, Rating)
- **Order** (OrderID, CustomerID, Quantity, Date, Status)
- **OrderItem** (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity)
- **Customers** (CustomerID, Name, Email, Address)
- **Customer** (CustomerID, Name, PhoneNumber)
- **Warehouse** (WarehouseID, Name, LocationID)
- **Location** (LocationID, Address)
- **Category** (CategoryID, Name)

We designed an **ER Diagram** to define relationships between these entities, ensuring proper data structuring and integrity.

## üîç SQL Queries & Functionalities

### üî∏ Basic Queries

```sql
-- Retrieve all products
SELECT * FROM Products;

-- Get product details by category
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Electronics';
```

### üî∏ Advanced Queries

```sql
-- Which year had the highest sales? --

SELECT YEAR([date]) AS Year, SUM(Product.Price * Order_item.quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM [Order]
JOIN Order_item ON [Order].ID = Order_item.Order_ID
JOIN Product ON Order_item.product_ID = Product.ID
-- We joined the Order and Order_items tables.
-- We joined the Product and Order_item tables.
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
-- To get the total sales for EACH year.
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC

-- What is the average quantity of products ordered per order? --

SELECT AVG(quantity) AS AverageQuantityPerOrder
FROM (
    SELECT Order_ID, SUM(quantity) AS quantity
    FROM Order_item
    GROUP BY Order_ID
) AS OrderQuantities;

-- What are the top 5 products with the highest quantity in stock? --

SELECT TOP 5 p.ID, p.Price, p.weight, p.barcode, p.category_ID
FROM Product p
INNER JOIN Inventory i ON p.ID = i.Product_ID
ORDER BY i.quantity DESC;
```

### üî∏ Stored Procedure Example

```sql
-- Procedure to update stock after a sale
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateStock(IN product_id INT, IN quantity_sold INT)
BEGIN
    UPDATE Products
    SET StockQuantity = StockQuantity - quantity_sold
    WHERE ProductID = product_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### üî∏ Trigger for Automatic Stock Update

```sql
-- Trigger to prevent stock from dropping below zero
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_negative_stock
BEFORE UPDATE ON Products
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.StockQuantity < 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Stock cannot be negative';
    END IF;
END;
```

## üîß Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** for database management
- **DBMS Tools**: MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin for database visualization
- **ER Diagram**: Designed using dbdiagram.io

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ibraAbouZahr/Inventory-Management-System.git
   ```
2. Import the database schema into your SQL server.
3. Run the SQL queries to interact with the inventory system.
4. Modify queries as needed for specific inventory needs.

## üìù Future Enhancements

- Implement a **frontend interface** using React.js for easy interaction.
- Integrate with **Power BI/Tableau** for real-time inventory analytics.
- Add a **REST API** to allow external applications to interact with the database.
